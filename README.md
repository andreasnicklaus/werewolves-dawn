# Setting

**Better keep one eye open tonight!**

For a few weeks now, you and your fellow villagers have been finding dead animals in the woods randomly around your village. Someone or something is out for blood every night and there are no sign as to how this has been happening...

This morning, the eldest of the village has made a report of a chilling sighting. She swears to have seen what everyone has been afraid of: Werewolves!

After some panicked hours of discussion, you have made a foolproof plan: Tonight, everyone will stay up and be on the lookout for any suspicious activity. Tomorrow morning, you will vote on a suspicious villager and try to scare the other werewolves away. The lives of the whole village depend on it.

No one thinks of it, only the village's youngest asks: "But if I am awake tonight, won't you all think that I might be a werewolf?". He's right. Will you be able to sleep or will you try to find the evil and risk your own life in the process?

# What you will need

| What you will need   |   |
|---|---|
| Players  | You can play Werewolves - Dawn with 3-10 players at the same time. It is possible to have a game leader (a player or extra person) narrate your group through the game flow (like in the real game) or just follow the instructions on the screen. For a better immersion, you might want to adapt the back story to your group to fit the group dynamic.  |
| Location and Communication  | In order to play Werewolves - Dawn like it is intended to and make it fun for all players, you will have to be able to talk to each other. You can either be in the same room looking at your own screen or play in a online meeting. Don't have a meeting yet? Try [Zoom](https://zoom.us), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) or [Join](https://www.join.me/). **Attention**: This game is based on deception. If you can see each other doing something you might not want to be seen doing, you will give your role away and not have fun. It might be useful to <u>turn your camera and microphone off</u> during the round's night and turn it on again during the debate.  |
| Knowledge | Just like all of these games, Werewolves - Dawn is more fun when you play with people, who know the game's nicks just as well as you do. You can play with new players, but you should explain the roles and game flow in detail beforehand. See the chapters 'How to play' and 'roles' above.  |

# How to play

## Set up
Before you can start a game, you have to choose the roles you want to play with. You should always have more role cards than players in the game. This way, each round has the added mystery of which roles have not been dealt.

You can find some suggested scenarios and the required roles in the 'scenarios' chapter.

## Game flow
Each round of Werewolves - Dawn has the same game flow:

1. At the beginning of each round, all players 'close their eyes' so they cannot see the moves of the other players. In the online game, this is not necessary, but experienced players might be able to recognize your physical body movements while clicking and reading. You might resolve this problem is some other way (turning off your camera, putting your head in your hands etc).
2. During the night, each player plays out the action of his/her role. You can read the specific actions of each role in the 'roles' chapter.
3. After the village has slept through the night, all alive players can gather and debate who to vote out of the game. For this you have 5 minutes time (experienced players can lower this time limit). This completes the round and the winning players receive points for the survival of their species.

## End of the round
The winners of each round are determined by the player who has been voted out at the village council. This allows for 3 possible scenarios.

- A werewolf has been voted out: The danger for your group has been averted and the villagers win.
- A villager has been voted out: The village people have been deceived and the werewolves win.
- Nobody has been voted out: If there have not been any werewolves (all werewolf cards are in the middle), the villagers win. If a werewolf survives, then the werewolves win.


Each winning player receives 1 point. The player with the most points after the game wins it all!

# Roles

| Role | Team | Order | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Warden | 0  | Villager | Protects a player (not himself) at the beginning of the round from exchange and inspection |
| Werewolf | 2  | Werewolf | Wakes once with all werewolves, who will now be able to recognise each other. If alone, can look at a card in the middle |
| Alpha wolf | 2  | Werewolf | Wakes once with all werewolves, who will now be able to recognise each other. If alone, can look at a card in the middle. Wakes again after the other werewolves and switches an extra werewolf card with the role card of another player who is not a werewolf already unless protected by the warden |
| Seeing wolf | 2  | Werewolf | Wakes once with all werewolves, who will now be able to recognise each other. If alone, can look at a card in the middle. Wakes again after the other werewolves and can look at the role of another player unless protected by the warden |
| Ghost buster | 5  | Villager | Can look at two cards one after the other unless protected by the warden. If he chooses a werewolf, he becomes that role |
| Young seer | 5  | Villager | Can look at one card in the middle |
| Witch | 6 | Villager | Can look at a card in the middle. If she does so, she has to then switch that card with a players card (even her own) unless protected by the warden. That player will not wake again for his/her new role |
| Idiot | 7  | Villager | Switches all role cards but his own and the middle cards one spot to the left or right unless protected by the warden |
| Fortune teller | 7  | Villager | Gets to know all players who have performed an action that night |
| Scout | 10 | Villager | Can turn a single card for all players to see unless protected by the warden |
| Curator | 11 | Villager | Not implemented, don't use |
| Prince | -  | Villager | Cannot die. If he gets voted out, the player with the second most votes dies |
| Bodyguard | -  | Villager | The player, who gets voted by the bodyguard, cannot die. The player with the second most votes wins if he/she has at least 2 votes. Only use the bodyguard when playing with 5 or more players |
| Villager | -  | Villager | No special power. This role is easy to take as cover for werewolves, so be careful not to incriminate yourself |
| Sleeping werwolf | -  | Werewolf | Will be visible as a werewolf to other werewolves, but does not wake at night |
